Rough Work | Elementary OS

1. Printer installation:
hp-setup command

2. After VS Code installation:

Problem faced-
apt gives error
Err:1 http://packages.microsoft.com/repos
Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NOSPLIT' (does the network require authentication?)

Resolution-
Removed VS Code from apt
installed VS Code from snap
sudo snap install --classic code

Reason-
Possibly 
/etc/resolv.conf
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
Err:1 is gone because of this or for some other reason. Time on the machine was also not correct.
now VS Code can be installed using apt too.

Next-
Need to figure out why it was happening.
