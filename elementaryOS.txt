Rough Work | Elementary OS

1. Printer installation:
hp-setup command

2. After VS Code installation:

Problem faced-
apt gives error
Err:1 http://packages.microsoft.com/repos
Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NOSPLIT' (does the network require authentication?)

Resolution-
Removed VS Code from apt
installed VS Code from snap
sudo snap install --classic code

Reason-
I don't know. 
/etc/resolv.conf
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
Err:1 is gone because of this or for some other reason. Server certificate issues at that time on internet. Time on the machine was also not correct.
now VS Code can be installed using apt too.

Next-
Need to figure out why it was happening.
